1. Automated deployment for production will be done through terraform. All the insfrastructure is deployed using aws platform and terraform. just need to configure terraform on local along with AWS creds to deploy the terrarom code from local. 
if we need to setup github actions for deploying infrastructure we can authenticate the aws console with oicd connector which uses the IAM role to autheticate the user.

2. To backup major compenents like RDS and K8 I can configure the snapshots/ backup for RDS and for K8s I can use Velero backup.

3. To rollback the deployment there are couple of ways:
 i. Manually destroy the infrastructure and redeploy the previous state.
 ii. owerrite the last state on the current state and deploy the script. By this we can deploy the infra without downtime.
 iii. Application rollback can be performed on the bases of any failure in deployment in github workflow.

4. Scaling of the infra can be done on basis of indvidual component like for rds, scaling can be done in rds configuration and same is with K8s (for k8s I can use karpenter too if required).
 i. For applicaiton scalibitity I will use the replicasets.

5. For monitoring and logging I will use prometheus and grafana/ newrelic - For Appliction and infra both. For uptime purposes I will either use uptime bot/ pingdom.
